      "In XX/XX/XXXX I was injured at work and was unable to work. I my employer contested my workmans compensation claim and I fell behind in all my bills including my Mortgage with Wells Fargo. I called bi weekly, I informed the bank of what I was dealing with and that I expected the outcome to be in my favor. I spoke with the Bank at least twice every two weeks from XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, ( XX/XX/XXXX being the month I went to court with Compensation company ). I won the case and as stated, on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX the commission awarded me back pay and weekly amount until I go back to work. I called Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX regarding my case and the following are the 3 incidents that followed of which I am seeking assistance in repayment and clarity : 1 ) I called Wells Fargo to inform them that I won my case and payment was made to me in the form of a check on XX/XX/XXXX and that I would be paying the back amount in full by that Friday ( XX/XX/XXXX ) at the latest Monday ( XX/XX/XXXX ) because the check had to clear my credit union. At this time, A Wells Fargo Billing Representative named XXXX assured me that I was not in foreclosure and that making the payment of {$7100.00}. I had been in touch with them every week for 5 months telling them of my injury the court hearing for workmans comp. The attached documentation even says I was not in foreclosure and it is dated XX/XX/XXXX. However when I called to make the payment Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, a billing representative I told me that I went into foreclosure on XX/XX/XXXX. What? Was my reply and Why would the Wells Fargo, the day after I called telling them I could bring the account current, why would the bank put me in foreclosure, filing the very next day, even though their letter dated a day later stated no foreclosure?!! This is wrong! I want my money back, the reinstatement fees I was charged for their errors and in my opinion ... their greed. \n",
      "\n",
      "2 ) I wanted to reinstate my loan, and I was told the same amount ( {$7100.00} plus late fees ( {$500.00} ) making the total reinstatement cost to be {$7600.00} ) would be due by XX/XX/XXXX and that I also had to wait to pay the total amount until they could add the legal fees due to filing fees ) weeks later, they sent a confusing letter which still had late fees listed. The Bankruptcy/Foreclosure Manager I worked with was XXXX XXXX XXXX. Further, I was also was told the option to pay late payments after reinstatement was not policy until XX/XX/XXXX, yet the billing rep. tried to confuse me by saying it was there all along. Either way, Wells Fargos quoted me {$8600.00}, for full reinstatement of my loan, including all late fees, this was given by telephone and in writing in XX/XX/XXXX ( attached ). Where are all these new late fees coming from if my Loan was paid up and I had a clean slate to quote the bankruptcy/foreclosure department? I would have paid everything I owed including late payments when I received the quote if I this case had been that they were not included, they never state anything clearly. I do not owe them XX/XX/XXXX late fees, they were paid in the reinstatement payment of my loan. \n",
      "\n",
      "3 ) Mortgage increased w/o reason. When I asked why, I was given multiple different reasons but none where valid, from insurance increase to late fees to tax increase to late fees put on the back end of the loan, which in addition to this underhanded business practice, Wells Fargo was also late with the insurance payments to my chosen insurer, XXXX ( notice attached ) and caused the cancellation of homeowners insurance ; then Wells Fargo added their own insurance company as my provider, which was more expensive than XXXX. They tried to cover their tracks when I caught them, by saying that I was not charged for their insurance. \n",
      "\n",
      "Again,, my mortgage also increased by $ XXXXWhy? when I asked Wells Fargo Customer Representative, they gave me a plethora of reasons and excuses, none of which added up. I did the math, based on every account they gave me, primarily the two prevailing opinions of increase in my taxes and increase of my insurance, both of which are true. The increase in my taxes ( Taxes {$310.00} ) and Insurance ( {$180.00} ) would only equal a {$41.00} increase in my payments, not a {$98.00} increase. Mortgage with increase would be {$1400.00}, not the {$1500.00} I have been charged since XX/XX/XXXX. \n",
      "Please help me get to the bottom of this hodgepodge of hearsay and unfounded opinion. I now have to watch my Mortgage company for every little thing, monthly by calling to be sure that no new charges have been added nor miss charges applied. I do not own any late payments, they were paid in the loan reinstatement.\n",

      "I have a mortgage with Dovenmuehle / XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX in which I do not live. In XXXX my tenants fell behind in rent by several months, but because of Covid eviction restrictions I could not evict. I called DovenmuehleXXXX  in XXXX of XXXX and explained the situation and asked if there were any \" programs '' available to me for my situation. They granted me a 3-month forbearance period starting XX/XX/XXXX at the end of which the \" skipped '' payments were to be deferred to the end of the loan. Even though I was granted 3 months of forbearance, I skipped only 2 monthly payments at that time. I called DovenmuehleXXXX  and explained that I have resumed payments and requested my new amortization/payments schedule. The response was that my account was \" still being reviewed '' and that someone would contact me with my options. I explained that I did not understand because we have already decided on this 3-month covid hardship forbearance/deferral, but they simply told me that I was granted an additional 3 month forbearance/deferral period while my account was being reviewed. I continued with one more monthly payment even though they granted me this extension. I called again towards the end of this second 3-month forbearance/deferral period to ask again what my steps were to complete this deferment and requested my new amortization/payment schedule. The response was the same as the first time I called. They simply explained that my account was being reviewed and that someone will contact me with my options even though I explained to them that my option had already been decided, that the \" skipped '' payments would be deferred. Their response was again to offer me another 3-month forbearance/deferment period and that someone will contact me with my options. When the 9-month forbearance/deferment period ended I had \" skipped '' only 5 monthly payments, but I started to receive past due balance notices. After countless phone calls the deferment was finally granted on XX/XX/XXXX, but the past due notices continued. I called and explained this error, but nobody could fix it. They then requested that I submit a \" Loss Mitigation '' application which I submitted. From that point on it has been a constant cycle of phone calls, foreclosure notices, court dates, them requesting more and more documentation ( pay stubs, tax forms, rental agreements, etc. etc. ) They have tacked on {$4100.00} in legal fees and are continuing with the foreclosure. Even though their lawyers sent to me a notice to appear in court ( for the 3rd time ) on XX/XX/XXXX they did not show up and the judge rescheduled the hearing to XX/XX/XXXX. The boiler now needs to be replaced and my tenants are without heat, but I can not replace the {$13000.00} boiler until the foreclosure has been resolved. Because of this my tenants will need to move out, so now I will lose my rental income. Due to Dovenmuehle'sXXXX XXXX processing errors, this investment will be wiped out. I simple 15-minute phone call back in XX/XX/XXXX when I called could have avoided this entire mess. I am now considering filing a lawsuit if this does not get corrected and resolved before I suffer any more losses due to their errors.\n",
